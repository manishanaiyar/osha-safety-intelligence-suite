Error analysis revealed that the model learned the dataset's ground truth correctly — including the counterintuitive finding that amputation cases are labeled Minor when treated outpatient. This highlights a fundamental data quality consideration: the OSHA Hospitalized field is an administrative outcome measure, not a clinical severity measure. For production deployment, a composite severity label combining Hospitalized, Amputation, days away from work, and treatment type would produce a more meaningful and clinically accurate target variable.\n",
